## Jeopardy Web App 

Utilizing the Jeopardy API provided at <u> http://jservice.io/ </u>, I created a web application that allows a user to search for questions from various dates, categories, and difficulty levels. This web application also contains settings to try out a random episode's questions or to try out an extra difficult question as "final jeopardy"! This web application can be accessed at <u> maya-choudhury.shinyapps.io/project/</u>.
